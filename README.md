# Databases

The artifact for the Databases category is the creation of basic MySQL statements for a SQL database. The artifact was used in the report for DAD 220: Introduction to SQL and was created in November of 2019. This artifact uses a messaging database, a person table, an image table, and a message-image table. The database and tables were utilized for demonstrating create, read, update, and delete for the MySQL language. Having a minimal knowledge of scripting at the time, I decided to enhance this artifact for illustrating my improved scripting and database abilities.

The original artifact functionality consists of basic SQL commands for CRUD operations. The features of the original code include the creation of the mesaging database, altering the person table, initializing the image table, and combining the message database with the image table in the message-image table. Additional features include inserting a value into the person table, deleting a value from the person table, and creating two tables named hello and horror for demonstrating functionality within the MySQL terminal used for execution. Though the code segments may not have errors, the functionality of the original code requires significant advancements to be sufficient.
