# Databases

The artifact for the Databases category is the creation of basic MySQL statements for a SQL database. The artifact was used in the report for DAD 220: Introduction to SQL and was created in November of 2019. This artifact uses a messaging database, a person table, an image table, and a message-image table. The database and tables were utilized for demonstrating create, read, update, and delete for the MySQL language. Having a minimal knowledge of scripting at the time, I decided to enhance this artifact for illustrating my improved scripting and database abilities.
