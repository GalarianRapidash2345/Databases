<h1>Databases</h1>
  
<p>This artifact is for the Databases category. The artifact for the Databases category is the creation of basic MySQL statements for a SQL database. 
  The artifact is a part of a report for DAD 220: Introduction to SQL and was developed in November 2019. 
  This artifact uses a messaging database, a person table, an image table, and a message-image table. 
  The database and tables utilize create, read, update, and delete for the MySQL language. 
  Having had minimal knowledge of scripting, I enhanced this artifact to illustrate my improved scripting and database abilities.</p>
